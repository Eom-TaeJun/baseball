MLB 2024 Plate Appearance (PA) Breakdown Analysis - Shortstop (SS)

## 1. Objective

To create a comprehensive and statistically consistent probability model of all possible outcomes of a plate appearance for the Shortstop (SS) position, based on the provided 2024 data.

## 2. Methodology

1.  **Data Source:** All initial counts (`PA`, `H`, `BB`, `SO`, etc.) are taken from the `mlb2024ss.csv` file.

2.  **Event Definition:** We define a set of mutually exclusive events (Hits, Walks, Strikeouts, and Other Outs) whose counts sum exactly to the total Plate Appearances for this position.

3.  **Batted Out Estimation:** As position-specific batted-out data was unavailable, we calculated the total "Other Outs" (non-strikeout outs) for this position. This total was then apportioned into `Flyouts`, `Groundouts`, and `Line Drive Outs` using the league-wide proportions derived from the `stats2024.csv` file. This provides a reasonable estimate for the batted-out distribution.

4.  **Normalization & Logits:** All final probabilities are calculated to 10 decimal places and then normalized to ensure the sum is exactly 1.0. Corresponding logits (`log(probability)`) are also calculated for use in statistical modeling.
